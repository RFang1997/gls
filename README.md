Process model verification chain

The goal of this project is to produce a SimplePDL process model verification chain in order to check their consistency, in particular to determine whether or not the described process can be completed. To answer this question, we use the model-checking tools defined on Petri networks through the Tina toolbox. We therefore have to translate a process model into a Petri network.
To achieve this goal, we used the Eclipse EMF framework composed of tools such as Ecore, OCL, Acceleo, Sirius, Xtext and ATL.
